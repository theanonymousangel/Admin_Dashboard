## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Near black (#212121) for a high contrast modern look
- Background color: Very light grey (#f5f5f5). Should be obviously related in hue to the near-black of the primary color, but almost fully desaturated and very bright
- Accent color: Deep blue (#003399). Offers good visual contrast and adds a touch of brand identity.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. These provide a clean and modern aesthetic
- Use a set of minimalist line icons from a library such as 'Font Awesome' or 'Feather Icons' for navigation and actions.
- Use a card-based layout for product, order, and customer summaries.
- Subtle hover animations and transitions for interactivity and feedback.
